<h1>Apple Riddle</h1>
<p> I wrote this code to solve a riddle my dad saw on WhatsApp. No one he knew had the answer and it wasn't on Google. I wrote this for him.</p>

<h3>Riddle:</h3>
<p>A person in the farmer's market saw a stall selling apples. The person was curious how many apples that farmer had. They asked him
and the farmer replied, "I don't know exactly. I am a simple man who can't count too high, but I do know this: 
If I divide my apples into 2 groups, there is one leftover. If I divide them into 3 groups, there is still one leftover. 
The same can be said for groups of 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. All have one left over. If, however, I divide my apples into a group of 11, 
then I have no leftover apples."</p>
<p>How many apples are there?</p>
